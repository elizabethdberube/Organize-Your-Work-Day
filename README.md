# Organize-Your-Work-Day

This is a simple calendar application where a user can save events for each hour of the day.

Features of this application:
The current date is displayed at the top of the page.
There are timeblocks covering each standard business hour. 
Timebolcks are color-coded so users can easily know if it is in past, present, or future.
Users can select a timeblock then enter an event and then save the event.
The event is saved to local storage and will stay even if the page is refreshed.
